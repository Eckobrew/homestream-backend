# Android handoff: HomeStream 1.2 music, Discover, Requested and Admin

Updated 8 November 2026. This file is the implementation handoff for an AI working on the Android application. No Android checkout was changed in this task. Backend source and generated contracts are authoritative; do not invent DroppedNeedle endpoints in the Android app.

## Goal and current backend

Rename the existing Requests/discovery tab to **Discover** and add **Requested** immediately next to it. Both cover movies, TV and music, not just music. Discover finds and requests content; Requested tracks requested content, download/import states, progress and release dates. Add an Admin section for integration configuration. Keep existing Home/TV/Movies playback and pairing working.

Backend: https://github.com/Eckobrew/homestream-backend . Web reference: https://github.com/Eckobrew/homestream-web . The public contract is **1.2.0**, API major path remains **v1** and existing 1.1 routes remain supported. Generated definitions: `contract/openapi.json`, `contract/models.ts`, `contract/paths.d.ts`. Kotlin/OkHttp bindings: `contract/kotlin/src/main/kotlin/uk/eckonet/homestream/api/` (regenerate using `npm run contract:kotlin`, do not edit generated files). API client calls are blocking: use Dispatchers.IO and close every binary okhttp Response.

Implementation locations: `src/services/music/handler.ts`, `src/lib/droppedneedle.ts`, `src/services/requested/handler.ts`, `src/lib/requested-media.ts`, `src/services/integrations/handler.ts`, `src/services/mobile/v1/[...path]/handler.ts`, `src/api-schema.ts`, `src/public-api.ts`. Web reference components: DiscoverHub, RequestedPanel, MusicBrowser, MusicPlayer, AdminIntegrations, Navbar.

## Authentication and pairing

Use the saved HomeStream server URL and existing `Authorization: Bearer <paired-device token or signed mobile session>` on native API requests, artwork and audio requests. Never embed Jellyfin/Seerr/qBittorrent/DroppedNeedle service credentials in the app. Never log bearer headers, credentials, stream URLs with tickets, or auth response bodies. Handle 401 by sign-in/re-pair; do not retry indefinitely.

LAN scanning/pairing must continue on **port 3000**, without requiring manual input. The live gateway allows automatic pairing only for direct LAN-IP requests from the home LAN, with no incoming forwarding headers, excluding configured upstream reverse proxies. Do not send X-Forwarded-For, Forwarded, X-Real-IP or X-HomeStream-Local-Pairing from Android. The server owns identity and pairing admission. Check `GET /api/mobile/v1/discovery` and `localPairing`; POST `/api/mobile/v1/auth/pair` with the existing deviceId/deviceName shape. After pairing keep the returned public externalUrl for normal remote access. Public-hostname pairing stays blocked. There is no published backend port 3001.

Remote Jellyfin login remains `POST /api/mobile/v1/auth/login` with `{username,password}`. New signed mobile sessions include a server-verified admin claim derived from Jellyfin's Policy.IsAdministrator; clients cannot set this claim. An older session may require a fresh sign-in to obtain admin privileges. `GET /api/mobile/v1/capabilities` returns optional `canManageIntegrations`; it is false for ordinary paired devices/household tokens and ordinary signed users. Do not treat editable profile.isAdministrator or LAN connectivity as native admin proof.

## Discover: all media

Keep movie/TV discovery and movie/TV request dialog using existing native `home`, `search`, `categories/{type}`, `media/{id}`, `request` endpoints. `home.requestSections` provides existing video discovery rows. The legacy category name `requests` and singular movie/TV `/request` API are deliberately retained; renaming UI navigation does not rename these APIs. The web accepts legacy `?tab=requests` links as Discover.

Add All media / Movies / TV / Music filters. For music:

- `GET /api/mobile/v1/music` -> `{configured, albums: MusicAlbum[], total}`: imported music library. Optional `offset` for library pagination; each page is up to 200 albums. Continue until loaded count reaches total.
- `GET /api/mobile/v1/music?q=<artist or album>` -> catalog album search (up to 30 results; refine query for more). Do not search on every keystroke: debounce and cancel obsolete calls.
- `GET /api/mobile/v1/music/album?albumId=<opaque id>` -> `{album: MusicAlbum, tracks: MusicTrack[]}`. Empty tracks means not imported/playable yet; show request state instead of pretending playback is available.
- `POST /api/mobile/v1/music/request` body `{musicbrainzId:"release-group UUID"}` -> `{success,message,status}`. This requests an **album** through DroppedNeedle and its configured download client. Track playback is supported; individual-track acquisition is not a separate HomeStream operation in this version. A successful request is not a completed download. Respect pending/approval/error states and refresh Requested. Do not silently issue requests just by opening an album.

MusicAlbum: id, title, artist, optional year/releaseDate/coverUrl/trackCount, inLibrary and requested booleans. MusicTrack: opaque id, title, artist, album, trackNumber, discNumber, optional durationSeconds, streamUrl. Keep MusicAlbum/MusicTrack separate from the old video MediaItem type, whose type enum still contains only Movie/Series/Episode.

HomeStream's live DroppedNeedle connection uses a dedicated **trusted, non-admin** companion account: explicit requests can dispatch downloads without approving server settings access. Queues reflect requests visible to the connected service account, not necessarily every request created by other DroppedNeedle users. Approval policy, quotas, matching, download clients and imports stay owned by DroppedNeedle. The Android client must not call slskd or download-client APIs directly.

## Music streaming

- `GET` or `HEAD /api/mobile/v1/music/stream?trackId=<opaque track id>`.
- Attach the HomeStream Authorization bearer header to the actual audio data source, including subsequent seek/range requests. Use Media3/ExoPlayer with an authenticated OkHttpDataSource/HttpDataSource. Do not redirect to DroppedNeedle or its filesystem.
- Streams are proxied from the fixed configured upstream, with client cancellation, Content-Type, Content-Length, Accept-Ranges, Content-Range, and HTTP 200/206/416 preserved. Support seeking; handle missing files and 502/503 as recoverable playback errors. No whole-track buffering in memory.
- Use returned streamUrl/coverUrl. Native responses use `/api/mobile/v1/music/...`; web responses use `/api/v1/music/...`. Resolve relative URLs against the saved server origin. Never blindly use web-cookie URLs from an old cached response with a native token.
- `GET /api/mobile/v1/music/artwork?albumId=...` is authenticated. Add the same bearer header to Coil/Glide requests. Covers may be absent/warming; show a music placeholder rather than failing the album list.
- Provide persistent queue, play/pause, next/previous, track duration/seek controls and foreground audio service/media notification. Handle audio focus, headphone removal, cancellation, closing the player, profile changes and activity recreation. Starting video must stop music, and vice versa. Keep music playback alive across navigation, not across a forbidden Kids profile switch.
- Imported audio is streamed in its available format (e.g. MP3/FLAC). This endpoint does not promise video-style HLS or transcoding, and incomplete music downloads are not playable until imported.

## Requested: unified queue

`GET /api/mobile/v1/requested` -> `{items: RequestedItem[], warnings: string[], updatedAt}`. Poll about every 10 seconds only while the screen is visible, prevent overlapping polls, cancel on exit, and refresh after successful movie/TV/music requests. One failing integration produces warnings while other services remain visible. Do not replace an unavailable service with fake/demo downloads.

RequestedItem: id, title, kind (`movie`/`tv`/`music`), source (`seerr`/`qbittorrent`/`droppedneedle`), status; optional artist, posterUrl, releaseDate, requestedAt, progress, downloadSpeed, etaSeconds, media. `media` is an existing video MediaItem where available; use it to open the video detail/request flow. Progress is **0–100**, unlike raw qBittorrent's 0–1. Never confuse download progress with watched/playback progress. Missing/null/unknown progress is unknown, not 0 or 100. Movies/TV can be awaiting approval, requested, downloading, importing, available or declined; render new status strings gracefully. Several episodes may be aggregated into one requested-series progress value weighted by file size. Ambiguous title matches stay separate rather than showing another download's progress.

Provide All media / Movies / TV / Music filters, a visible status label, determinate bar only for known progress, optional speed and reasonable ETA, and release date. Date precision is meaningful: `2027` means year only, `2027-04` month only, `2027-04-03` a calendar date. Never invent January 1 for year-only metadata or shift dates across timezones by treating LocalDate as an instant. Unknown dates must say unknown. TV release dates can describe the next scheduled episode when the upstream provides one. Music history may provide only a year. Dates are metadata, not guarantees that a download is obtainable. The queue includes the latest up to 100 requests/history records per upstream and current downloads, scoped by connected account visibility.

## Admin integrations

Native endpoints: `GET /api/mobile/v1/integrations`, `POST /api/mobile/v1/integrations`. Require a **signed mobile administrator session** from Jellyfin login. Household/paired-device tokens and non-admin sessions receive 403 even on the LAN. Show Admin only when capabilities.canManageIntegrations is true; still handle server 403. Web uses `/api/v1/integrations` with its normal local/admin authorization policy.

GET -> `{integrations:[{id,name,url,configured,credentialSet,username?}], downloadsPath}`. IDs: jellyfin, seerr, qbittorrent, droppedneedle. No stored API key/password/token is returned. POST:

```json
{"integration":"droppedneedle","action":"save","url":"http://music-server:8688","secret":"new companion token or blank to preserve"}
```

`action` is save or test. Test uses unsaved inputs without persisting them. Optional username for qBittorrent, downloadsPath for its backend-container mount, parentPin if configured. Blank secret preserves the existing credential. Clearing URL disconnects the integration. Mask secret fields, disable autofill/logging of submitted values, clear secrets from form state after save, and never place them in a URL. Configured parent/Kids policies still apply. HTTP(S) URLs may contain a deployment path but no embedded username/password, query or fragment.

## Safety and compatibility

Music has no verified content-rating source in this integration; Kids profiles are denied music and Admin endpoints server-side. Requested filters video content under existing parent policy and omits music/downloads for Kids. Do not bypass these restrictions in the UI or by selecting an adult profile locally. Preserve existing signed sessions, device credentials, Jellyfin profile IDs and release URL behavior. No Android code should change server media ownership or mount paths.

## Tests and acceptance for the Android AI

1. Existing port-3000 LAN scanning/pairing succeeds; public pairing and forged-forwarding-header attempts fail.
2. Old video routes, resume/progress/subtitles/casting remain functional.
3. Discover offers movies/TV/music; requesting one album is an explicit user action; repeated taps cannot launch duplicate requests.
4. Requested renders mixed fixture entries, unknown progress/date, year-only/month-only dates, future releases, paused/stalled/download/import/completed states, empty state and partial service failure.
5. Music library pagination, debounced search, album tracks, authenticated artwork and actual 206 range playback/seek work. Authorization survives media retries and seeks but is never sent to third-party hosts.
6. Queue survives screen navigation; switching track/profile, closing, starting video, loss of focus and activity recreation stop or transfer resources correctly.
7. Native Admin denies ordinary paired/user tokens, permits actual signed admin login, preserves blank saved credentials and never displays the stored secret.
8. Kids music/stream/admin requests remain 403; retries cannot evade server policy.
9. Use fake upstream fixtures for acquisition tests. Do not download arbitrary real albums while testing. Real-device decoding, background playback, audio focus and Android Auto/Cast remain Android-side acceptance checks.

Backend fixture coverage: `tests/music-integrations.test.ts`, `tests/requested-media.test.ts`, existing identity/parental/mobile tests. Web browser tests under `e2e/` cover the navigation, progress, Admin and music queue. Run backend build/tests/contract checks and compile generated Kotlin; then run Android unit/instrumented/player tests. See repository git history and CI for the final verified revision; this handoff is maintained with the implementation.
